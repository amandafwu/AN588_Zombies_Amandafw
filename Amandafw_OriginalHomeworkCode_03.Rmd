library(curl)
f <- curl("https://github.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/blob/master/AN588_Fall23/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #this is the typical path used in challenges but would give an error for me - "Error in open.connection(file, "rt") : Could not resolve host: github.com" 
#or 
d <- read.csv("zombies.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) #this seemed to be more effective
head(d)
summary(d)
